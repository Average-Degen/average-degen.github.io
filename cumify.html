        <h3>LoRA</h3>
        <p>
          To get a good cumify you will need a LoRA designed to add cum to
          images
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial will use my preferred LoRA
          <a
            href="https://civitai.com/models/10019/instant-cumshot"
            target="_blank"
            >Instant Cumshot</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To continue this guide you should first read the
          <a href="nudify.html#loras">LoRA section</a> of my nudify guide
        </p>
        <h3>Prompts</h3>
        <p>
          The prompts that you use to cumify depend on what you are looking for
          in the output
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a generic example using the
          <a
            href="https://civitai.com/models/10019/instant-cumshot"
            target="_blank"
            >Instant Cumshot</a
          >
          LoRA and it's trigger words
          <br />Prompt:
          <code
            >cumshot, cum on face, cum string,
            &lt;lora&colon;instantCumshot_v1&colon;1.25&gt;</code
          >
          <br />Negative:
          <code
            >lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra
            digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal
            quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry,
            anime, drawing, illustration</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you play around with the weights of the prompts and the LoRA
          to find what works best for you
        </p>
        <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
        <p>
          The settings that you use are very important when cumifying <br />They
          determine how much cum to add and how much to change the body when
          adding cum
        </p>
        <div class="table-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Setting</th>
                <th>Value</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Masked content</td>
                <td>original</td>
                <td>
                  This has to be original otherwise the result will not include
                  the face
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>CFG Scale</td>
                <td>7 &dash; 12</td>
                <td>
                  Determines how much weight to put on the prompt and hence how
                  much cum to add to the image
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Denoise strength</td>
                <td>0.2 &dash; 0.5</td>
                <td>
                  Determines much to change from the original image. A value of
                  1 would probably be just cum with no visible face
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <h3 id="inpainting">Inpainting</h3>
        <p>
          The most important thing when inpainting is to not mask over any
          important features like the eyes that cannot be recreated accurately
        </p>
        <p>
          You want to only mask over the features which you are OK with losing
          partially
        </p>
        <p>These are examples of good masking</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          It may take a lot a tweaking of settings and weights to get a good
          result <br />But just like nudifying the best way to get a good result
          is experiment and finding out for yourself
