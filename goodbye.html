            Hey anons,
            <br>
            <br>
            For a while now I've felt unsatisfied with my life, wasting my spare time doing shit like this rather than doing anything productive.
            <br>
            <br>
            That's why hence forth Average Degen is dead. I am never visiting 4chan again, I am never logging back into this account. I'm going to delete my deepfake bot and my nudify guide. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Nobody should be drawn down the same path that I followed a year ago, wasting their time on illegal, degenerate shit that only brings depression and loneliness. I was 15 when I discovered nudifying, think what that discovery could do to yourself at 15. That one mistake was all that it took to for me to throw my life into the gutter. I've already been question by police months ago for something relating to this, I really can't do that again.
            <br>
            Sorry that this has to happen, sorry I lied to people, I need to do this for my own sake.
