        This guide will being using a fork of a popular one-click face swap tool
        called
        <a href="https://github.com/s0md3v/roop" target="_blank">Roop</a>
        <br />We will be using a fork called
        <a href="https://github.com/C0untFloyd/roop-unleashed" target="_blank"
          >Roop Unleashed</a
        >. This is because Roop has been discontinued and Roop Unleashed has
        more features
      </p>
      <div class="info-container">
        <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
        <p>
          The easiest way to install Roop Unleashed is by using the one-click
          installer
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1&colon; Download Installer</h3>
        <p>
          This installer can be found in the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/C0untFloyd/roop-unleashed/releases"
            target="_blank"
            >releases</a
          >
          page of the GitHub repository
          <br />You just need to download the latest
          <code>roop-unleashed_win</code> zip file and place it in the directory
          that you want to install to
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2&colon; Extract Contents</h3>
        <p>
          Now to install the program you need to first extract the zip file
          <br />To do this you can either use a program like
          <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0" target="_blank"
            >WinRAR</a
          >
          or you can just right click the file and select
          <code>Extract All</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Run Roop Unleashed</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you have extracted the contents of the zip file you can find
          the file <code>windows_run.bat</code> you use this file to launch the
          web UI <br />The first run will take some time because it has to
          download all the required files
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the setup is completed it will open to the address
          <code>127.0.0.1:7860</code>
          <br />This means that you can't open both Stable Diffusion and Roop
          Unleashed at the same time without changing the port number
          &lpar;<code>7860</code>&rpar; in either of the program's settings
          <br />I recommend changing the port of Stable Diffusion as I have had
          some errors trying to modify the settings in Roop Unleashed <br />To
          change the port you simply add <code>--port xxxx</code>to the
          commandline args of webui-user.bat and replace <code>xxxx</code> with
          your desired port number
        </p>
        <h4>Side Note</h4>
        <p>
          If you encounter any errors you may need to download and install
          <a
            href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/"
            target="_blank"
            >Visual Studio</a
          >
          and select the C++ package during installation
        </p>

        <h2>Deepfaking</h2>
        <h3>Inputs</h3>
        <h4>Choosing Input</h4>
        <p>
          When choosing an input for a face you are looking for an image that is
          not blurry and has good lighting
        </p>
        <p>
          When choosing a target look for something that features an
          unobstructed face that is facing the camera
        </p>
        <h4>Inputting</h4>
        <p>
          Before you do anything you first need to upload the inputs for
          deepfaking
        </p>
        <p>
          The first upload box titled <code>Source Face Image</code> is where
          you will upload the images of the face that you want to transplant
          onto the deepfake
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have uploaded an image here it will be processed and the
          image of the face will appear in the box above
          <br />This is where you will select the face that you want to use if
          the image contains multiple faces
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>Target File&lpar;s&rpar;</code> box is where you can upload
          as many destination files as you want <br />Roop Unleashed supports
          deepfaking of both images and videos
        </p>
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <h4>Face Swap Method</h4>
        <p>
          Here is where you select the method that will be used to find the
          faces to target when swapping
        </p>
        <p>
          All the options are quite self-explanatory, you just choose which one
          best suits your desired result
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>Max Face Similarity Threshold</code> defines how strict to
          be when checking for the face selected by the swapping method
          <br />This does not apply if using <code>All Faces</code> swapping
          method
        </p>
        <h4>Post-Processing</h4>
        <p>
          Using post-processing will drastically slow down Roop Unleashed but
          will produce higher quality results
        </p>
        <p>
          This is nessesary for high quality results as the developer of the
          model used by Roop Unleashed has only realased a 128x128 resolution
          version
          <br />This means that the maximum resolution for output faces is
          128x128 pixels without post-processing
        </p>
        <p>
          The upscaler that you use depends on your personal preference but I
          find that <code>DMDNet</code>preserves facial features the best
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>Original/Enhanced image blend ratio</code> defines how much
          to blend the upscaled face with the original <br />This is another
          setting you should play around with to find the best result
        </p>
        <h3>Generation</h3>
        <p>
          To deepfake all the files that you uploaded all you need to do is
          press the orange <code>Start</code> button and wait for it to finish
        </p>
        <p>
          Once done the results will appear in the
          <code>roop-unleashed/output</code> folder <br />I recommend going to
          the settings tab and unchecking the option that says
          <code>Clear output folder before each run</code> as this will delete
          all previous results from the output folder and may result in lost
          files
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to upload any videos you do to 4chan you can also change
          the
          <code>Video Output Format</code> to <code>webm</code> and decrease the
          <code>Video Quality &lpar;crf&rpar;</code> to decrease file size
          <br />The main <code>Face Swap</code> page also allows you to change
          the <code>Video FPS</code>, this helps decrease file size
        </p>
        <p>
          To upload to /b/ you must also strip the audio from the file
          <br />You may be able to do this by selecting
          <code>Skip audio</code> before generating the deepfake <br />But if
          that doesn't work you can use
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>
          to strip the audio with this command: <br /><code
            >ffmpeg -i input_file.webm -vcodec copy -an output_name.webm</code
          >
          <br />Just make sure to replace <code>input_file.webm</code> with the
          name of the file you want to process
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you press <code>Apply Settings</code> after changing any of
          these values
        </p>

        <h2>Better Deepfake Software</h2>
        <p>
          While Roop Unleashed can produce passable deepfakes the often low
          quality of the fakes is an inherent issue with on-click deepfakes
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain a higher quality deepfake you should use
          <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab" target="_blank"
            >DeepFaceLab</a
          >
          <br />This tool takes much longer than Roop as it involves training a
          model on the source face and requires some input from the user
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot provide a guide on DeepFaceLab as I am not nearly experienced
          enough to be offering advice <br /><a
            href="https://mrdeepfakes.com/forums/threads/guide-deepfacelab-2-0-guide.3886/"
            target="_blank"
            >This guide</a
          >
          is the best way to learn to use the deepfake program
          <br />It goes into detail on the process of deepfaking and the
          settings involved
