    <p>
      This guide will being using a fork of a popular one-click face swap tool
      called <a href="https://github.com/s0md3v/roop">Roop</a> <br />We will be
      using a fork called
      <a href="https://github.com/C0untFloyd/roop-unleashed">Roop Unleashed</a>.
      This is because Roop has been discontinued and Roop Unleashed has more
      features
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way to install Roop Unleashed is by using the one-click
        installer
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1&colon; Download Installer</h3>
      <p>
        This installer can be found in the
        <a href="https://github.com/C0untFloyd/roop-unleashed/releases"
          >releases</a
        >
        page of the GitHub repository
        <br />You just need to download the latest
        <code>roop-unleashed_win</code> zip file and place it in the directory
        that you want to install to
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2&colon; Extract Contents</h3>
      <p>
        Now to install the program you need to first extract the zip file
        <br />To do this you can either use a program like
        <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0">WinRAR</a> or you
        can just right click the file and select <code>Extract All</code>
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Run Roop Unleashed</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have extracted the contents of the zip file you can find
        the file <code>windows_run.bat</code> you use this file to launch the
        web UI <br />The first run will take some time because it has to
        download all the required files
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the setup is completed it will open to the address
        <code>127.0.0.1:7860</code>
        <br />This means that you can't open both Stable Diffusion and Roop
        Unleashed at the same time without changing the port number
        &lpar;<code>7860</code>&rpar; in either of the program's settings
        <br />I recommend changing the port of Stable Diffusion as I have had
        some errors trying to modify the settings in Roop Unleashed <br />To
        change the port you simply add <code>--port xxxx</code>to the
        commandline args of webui-user.bat and replace <code>xxxx</code> with
        your desired port number
      </p>
      <h4>Side Note</h4>
      <p>
        If you encounter any errors you may need to download and install
        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/"
          >Visual Studio</a
        >
        and select the C++ package during installation
      </p>

      <h2>Deepfaking</h2>
      <h3>Inputs</h3>
      <h4>Choosing Input</h4>
      <p>
        When choosing an input for a face you are looking for an image that is
        not blurry and has good lighting
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing a target look for something that features an unobstructed
        face that is facing the camera
      </p>
      <h4>Inputting</h4>
      <p>
        Before you do anything you first need to upload the inputs for
        deepfaking
      </p>
      <p>
        The first upload box titled <code>Source Face Image</code> is where you
        will upload the images of the face that you want to transplant onto the
        deepfake
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have uploaded an image here it will be processed and the image
        of the face will appear in the box above
        <br />This is where you will select the face that you want to use if the
        image contains multiple faces
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>Target File&lpar;s&rpar;</code> box is where you can upload as
        many destination files as you want <br />Roop Unleashed supports
        deepfaking of both images and videos
      </p>
      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <h4>Face Swap Method</h4>
      <p>
        Here is where you select the method that will be used to find the faces
        to target when swapping
      </p>
      <p>
        All the options are quite self-explanatory, you just choose which one
        best suits your desired result
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>Max Face Similarity Threshold</code> defines how strict to be
        when checking for the face selected by the swapping method <br />This
        does not apply if using <code>All Faces</code> swapping method
      </p>
      <h4>Post-Processing</h4>
      <p>
        Using post-processing will drastically slow down Roop Unleashed but will
        produce higher quality results
      </p>
      <p>
        This is nessesary for high quality results as the developer of the model
        used by Roop Unleashed has only realased a 128x128 resolution version
        <br />This means that the maximum resolution for output faces is 128x128
        pixels without post-processing
      </p>
      <p>
        The upscaler that you use depends on your personal preference but I find
        that <code>DMDNet</code>preserves facial features the best
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>Original/Enhanced image blend ratio</code> defines how much to
        blend the upscaled face with the original <br />This is another setting
        you should play around with to find the best result
      </p>
      <h3>Generation</h3>
      <p>
        To deepfake all the files that you uploaded all you need to do is press
        the orange <code>Start</code> button and wait for it to finish
      </p>
      <p>
        Once done the results will appear in the
        <code>roop-unleashed/output</code> folder <br />I recommend going to the
        settings tab and unchecking the option that says
        <code>Clear output folder before each run</code> as this will delete all
        previous results from the output folder and may result in lost files
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to upload any videos you do to 4chan you can also change the
        <code>Video Output Format</code> to webm and decrease the
        <code>Video Quality &lpar;crf&rpar;</code> to decrease file size
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you press <code>Apply Settings</code> after changing any of
        these values
      </p>
